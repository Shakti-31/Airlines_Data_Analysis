#  Airline Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline-related data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The dataset used is sourced from **Kaggle** (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitgrewal/airlines-flights-data) and the analysis is performed entirely in **Google Colab** by me. The goal is to apply data analytics techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and deriving actionable insights from the dataset.

## Dataset Details

* **Source:** Kaggle
* **Dataset Name:** \[Airline Dataset from Kaggle]
* **File Format:** CSV (`.csv`)
* **Number of Rows:** *Specify exact number after loading the dataset*
* **Number of Columns:** *Specify exact number after loading the dataset*
* **Size:** *Mention file size in MB*

### **Column Descriptions**

1. **Airline** – Name of the airline company.
2. **Flight Date** – Date of the flight.
3. **Source City** – City from which the flight departs.
4. **Destination City** – City where the flight arrives.

8. **Stops** – Number of stops before reaching the destination.
9. **Additional Info** – Any other extra details provided by the airline.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
* **Google Colab** for coding and execution
* **Kaggle** for dataset sourcing

## Key Analysis Performed

* Data Cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, and data formatting)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for trend detection
* Price distribution analysis based on class, airline, and duration
* Impact of stops on ticket pricing
* Time-based flight trends and seasonality insights

##  Visualizations

* Price vs. Airline
* Price distribution by class
* Duration vs. Price scatter plots
* Heatmaps for correlations
* Trends over time
